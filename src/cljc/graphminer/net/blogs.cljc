Now they worry about me less, and I think that difference improved quality of life for my family significantly. There are some things I think I've done consciously to make this happen, and I'll share those here. If your parents are worried about you all the time (or if you're a worried parent), then this may be useful.
- Here's what my parents worrying looked like. One day I would go on a walk after school. When I get back, I find my mom crying. It turns out she'd been texting me every five minutes for the past few hours. Or I would complain about my teacher one day, and then my mom would ask me \"Are you getting along with that teacher you mentioned?\" over and over again for weeks.  Or I would eat dinner out one day, and the next morning I would find out my mom was worried, thinking I might not have eaten dinner at all. I was causing a half dozen concurrent worries at any given time.
- Often I wouldn't know why she was worried. Then I would consider that worry \"not my problem\" and ignore it. Other times, I would figure out my mom was worried. Then I'd say 
\"walking around in the woods is actually good for me. Next time I do that, don't be so worried\" or \"Oh, I actually switched classes a week ago. Everything's fine now.\" Neither of these were remotely useful. My parents, and others, tried to tell me what is doing wrong. I remember phrases like \"she wants you to acknowledge her feelings\" or \"respect your mother,\" but none of it got to me at the time.
- I think my fundamental problem back then, other than being an immature child, was that **I thought she worried about me because she didn't understand what I actually needed** and her worry was a misguided attempt to improve my life. This is somewhat true, but it was counterproductive for actually decreasing worry. My model now, which works much better is that we each have internal problems which make life harder for each other**. didn't separate my internal problems from her internal problems
